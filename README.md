# ANN_loan_project
This is basically a Loan Approval project using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This is a classification project using ANN. Basically, this model will predict based on the user input, whether loan to that particular user should be approved or not.
# Frontend and Database
I have used Flask, HTML/CSS for frontend designing. And also the data will be stored in a database, so that we can retrieve that data anytime. I have used sqlite3 for database management in this project.
